We ran our first test piece early because we were at a stage where we needed more cables from viewers -- we got some! With the help of our audience sending in a few failed cables, we were able to reach 3 firm conclusions (or, really, 2+1) of causes for failures of these adapter cables (and unadapted ones, too). Of course, there may be even more reasons -- but we believe these 3 to be the primary ones. Between foreign object debris in manufacturing (seems uncommon, but a cause) and user error, we were able to make a few cables melt. On the user error front, remember one key thing: Even if yours doesn't start fully unseated and is only partly unseated, it can work its way loose over time if you move cables around, do some cleanup, move the system, etc.\n\nWatch our first video in this series! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKjZ1djp8c\n\nNew GN 3D Coaster Pack: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\nGN PC Building Anti-Static Modmat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nGN Red & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-red-black-hud-mouse-mat\nGN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\r\nLike our content?

We ran our first test piece early because we were at a stage where we needed more cables from viewers -- we got some! With the help of our audience sending in a few failed cables, we were able to reach 3 firm conclusions (or, really, 2+1) of causes for failures of these adapter cables (and unadapted ones, too). Of course, there may be even more reasons -- but we believe these 3 to be the primary ones. Between foreign object debris in manufacturing (seems uncommon, but a cause) and user error, we were able to make a few cables melt. On the user error front, remember one key thing: Even if yours doesn't start fully unseated and is only partly unseated, it can work its way loose over time if you move cables around, do some cleanup, move the system, etc.\n\nWatch our first video in this series! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKjZ1djp8c\n\nNew GN 3D Coaster Pack: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\nGN PC Building Anti-Static Modmat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large\nGN Red & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-red-black-hud-mouse-mat\nGN Blue & Black Mouse Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-wireframe-mouse-mat\n\r\nLike our content?
